* Read data into R, merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, and created one file for it.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Renamed the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Created an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

*Pushed all changed into my repo, and in this folder you should have the following files:

1, Data folder, which contains all the data downloaded for the project
and tidy dataset

2, run_analysis.R is the script I used to get the tidy data set

3, code_book, contains all variables in the new tidy dataset

4,readme.md which explains what I did in the project.  (this file)
